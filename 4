Bayesian Adaptive Patient Recruitment Model — Plain Text Explanation

This model provides a statistically principled, dynamically updating forecast of patient recruitment in a multi-country clinical trial.
It combines historical data, real-time enrollment observations, and a probabilistic understanding of uncertainty to produce daily-updating projections.

The model is built around three key ideas:
	1.	Patient arrivals behave like a Poisson process
	2.	Enrollment rates are uncertain and modeled with a Gamma prior
	3.	Forecasts improve (“learn”) every day through Bayesian updating

Below is a step-by-step explanation of the full system.

⸻

1. Recruitment as a Poisson Arrival Process

In clinical trials, patient enrollment at a site is unpredictable but follows a pattern observed across thousands of studies:
	•	Each site recruits patients randomly over time
	•	Some days have zero enrollments, others have one or two
	•	Rarely do we see bursts of many patients in a day

This randomness is well described by a Poisson process.

If the true rate at a site were λ patients per day, the number of patients enrolled on a given day would follow:

Daily enrolled patients ~ Poisson(λ)

This is not an assumption unique to this model — it is standard in trial simulation, recruitment forecasting, and queueing processes.

2. We Don’t Know the True Enrollment Rate (λ)

Every site and every country has an underlying “true” enrollment rate.
But this rate is never known exactly — especially early in a trial.

To represent this uncertainty, we model λ using a Gamma distribution. This is called a “prior distribution”: it captures what we believe before seeing the current trial data.

Each country gets its own Gamma prior:
	•	The mean of the prior comes from historical performance
	•	The variance of the prior comes from how inconsistent the country historically is
	•	Narrow variance → country historically performs consistently
	•	Wide variance → country has more variation across past trials

If only a few past trials exist, the prior can be scaled weaker; if many past trials exist, it can be scaled stronger.

3. Why Gamma? Because Gamma + Poisson is perfectly conjugate

This is the mathematical reason the model works so smoothly.

A Gamma prior combined with a Poisson likelihood gives a Gamma posterior:

Posterior = Prior + Observed Data

This allows the model to update instantly and analytically every day.

The updated posterior parameters are:
	•	α (alpha) increases when more patients enroll
	•	β (beta) increases with more site-days observed

Interpretation:
	•	More patients → higher estimated enrollment rate
	•	More days with few patients → rate estimate goes down
	•	More observation time → uncertainty decreases

The posterior represents our new belief about λ after observing real data.

4. Daily Bayesian Updating: The Model Learns Every Day

Each day:
	1.	We gather all data collected up to that day
	2.	We update the Gamma posterior for each country
	3.	We update the uncertainty on the underlying enrollment rate
	4.	We re-forecast the rest of the trial using this updated belief

This makes the model adaptive.

Early forecasts are uncertain and wide.
As the trial progresses, forecasts become tighter and more stable.

5. Forecasting: Posterior Predictive Simulation

Once we know the posterior distribution of λ (rate per site), we generate forward-looking forecasts.

For each simulation:
	1.	Sample a plausible enrollment rate for each site from its country’s Gamma posterior
	2.	Add up all site rates to get the total study-level enrollment rate
	3.	Simulate future enrollments day-by-day using the Poisson process
	4.	Stop when the simulation reaches the target sample size
	5.	Record how long it took

We repeat this many times (e.g., 500–2000 simulations) to generate:
	•	P10 (optimistic)
	•	P25
	•	P50 (median forecast)
	•	P75
	•	P90 (pessimistic)

These form the shaded forecast ribbon shown in the demo.

6. Hierarchical Modeling: Borrowing Strength Across Sites

The model uses a hierarchical structure:
	•	Priors are assigned at the country level
	•	Sites within a country share a common rate distribution

This allows the model to:
	•	Stabilize estimates for countries with few sites
	•	Let large countries influence their own posterior more strongly
	•	Avoid overreacting to noise in small or slow-starting regions

This is standard in modern Bayesian statistics and is extremely useful in clinical operations.

7. Daily Updating Simulator

The simulator walks through the trial day-by-day:
	1.	Looks at all data up to “today”
	2.	Updates priors → posteriors for each country
	3.	Runs the forecast
	4.	Stores the forecast labeled “as of day X”

The output is a complete timeline of how the forecast evolved.
This drives:
	•	The GIF animation
	•	The interactive slider
	•	The static final projection

8. Visualization: What Stakeholders See

The model provides:

A. Final Forecast Plot

Shows:
	•	Actual cumulative enrollment
	•	Posterior predictive median forecast
	•	Credible intervals (P25–P75, optional P10–P90)
	•	Target sample size
	•	Clear visualization of uncertainty decreasing over time

B. GIF Animation (forecast evolution)

Shows how the model adapts as more data arrives.

C. Interactive Slider (Jupyter)

Allows the user to scrub through days to see how:
	•	The posterior updated
	•	The forecast shifted
	•	Uncertainty tightened

This gives a transparent, intuitive explanation of Bayesian learning.

9. Why This Model Is Better Than Linear or Heuristic Forecasting

Traditional methods (linear extrapolation, moving averages, heuristics) suffer from:
	•	Overreacting to short-term noise
	•	Underreacting to structural changes
	•	Lack of uncertainty quantification
	•	No principled way to incorporate historical data
	•	No pooling across similar countries

The Bayesian approach provides:

⸻

✓ Statistically optimal blending of historical + current data

Automatically balances prior knowledge with real observations.

✓ Natural representation of uncertainty

Forecast bands directly reflect how confident we are.

✓ Rapid adaptation

If a country suddenly picks up or slows down, the posterior shifts quickly.

✓ Hierarchical pooling

Weak countries borrow strength; stable countries dominate their estimates.

✓ Day-by-day learning

The model evolves exactly the way a human forecaster does—just more objectively.
